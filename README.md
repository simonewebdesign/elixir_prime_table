# Elixir Prime Table

An application written in Elixir that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers. E.g. when N is 3:

    |      |    2 |    3 |    5 |
    |    2 |    4 |    6 |   10 |
    |    3 |    6 |    9 |   15 |
    |    5 |   10 |   15 |   25 |

## How to run it

## What I'm pleased with

## What would I do if I had more time

## ToDo

- [x] write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation
- [x] write a function to print a N+1 x N+1 table
- [] test with very large primes
- [] check for N to be numeric and > 0
- [x] add mix-test.watch, dogma, credo, dialyzer, ExDoc, ExCoveralls
- [] provide precompiled binaries for linux and OS X
